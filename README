This is an adaptation of the cucumber ftplugin (https://github.com/tpope/vim-cucumber) for Behat (http://behat.org).

Behat uses the same langage as cucumber (Gherkin), so indent and syntax scripts
are the same as cucumber runtime files.  Only the compiler and ftplugin change.

Features:

- autocompletion of steps (with '<C-X><C-O>')
- jump to step definition (**behat version from 2.2 and ctags are required**) with
tag commands '<C-]>', '<C-W>]', '<C-W>}'
- compiler plugin that allow you to run behat with ':make' and see errors in the quickfix
window
